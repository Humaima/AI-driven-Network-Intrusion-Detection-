# ðŸ“¶ AI-Driven Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

This repository contains a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) powered by an LSTM-based deep learning model, built using Streamlit for an interactive web interface. The model is trained on the KDD Cup '99 dataset, a well-known dataset for network intrusion detection.

# ðŸš€ Features

1. LSTM-based Model for intrusion detection
2. Preprocessing (encoding, scaling, train-test split)
3. Interactive UI with real-time predictions
4. Model evaluation with accuracy & loss metrics

# ðŸ“Œ Tech Stack

1. Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn
2. Streamlit for UI
3. Matplotlib & Plotly for visualization

# ðŸ›  Usage

git clone https://github.com/your-username/nids-lstm.git 

cd nids-lstm  

streamlit run app.py  

Enter network traffic data and get instant intrusion detection! ðŸš€
